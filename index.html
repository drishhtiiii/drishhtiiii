I see her embrace love even more when she was taken all hopes from. She's like the autumn leaf she says but I see her living the brightest and glow golden while she opens up her heart . She taught me love is all about giving and let it grow if you're willing to. She taught me a leaf detached from the branch , lying on cold hard ground also breathes . She taught me a love so strong will only teach you to love more . You're an autumn leaf she said . Glow golden she said.

                    Under the night sky, my body breaks into fragments- I'm
                    dumb and deaf at the same time. I've made so many memories
                    with this darkness since the day you left. My ripped heart
                    would ache and bleed seeing myself fall that fast. I smiled,
                    but I felt numb and I felt dead. "It'll be fine", I would hear
                    his voice and I would be silent for hours but he would listen 
                    to things I had buried deep inside. I would ignore him for hours
                    but he came back every time with a rose in his hand, saying "Sorry,
                    I couldn't get a lily at the store." For the very first time I
                    thought, I like rose. It's pretty.

                    and made them mine. I didn't notice because my love was blind.

                        Just when the death approaches, will I think I haven't lived...haven't lived at all. I'll want to get lost in the woods where everything is calm, that when I close my eyes I will see a young me in the air around..and as I walk swift and old it'll teach me so many things by the dawn. We'll step out of apathy, we'll leave all the jealousy and hate and we'll sink into the green to realise all this chaos we built to live better and live with pride has only got us injured in a while. I'll be bruised with mean words said to me because I wanted to stand up for myself ..and a little wounded because I'd let them describe my sanity. .because if I don't ..I'd be called arrogant ..or I'll be judged ..or so many ORs will surround my life ...that finally when I look at my  face in the river of your eyes ..I'll crave a healing ...I'll crave a dive deep into your eyes...but your eyes will cry me a river because then it won't be a place for us forever. .. we'll only have a while. And just so when I begin to write the story of my life, I'll close my eyes with  7 words underlining my entire life "are we building this to destroy ourselves ?"

                        Have you heard different voices echo the same name
                        If not more then maybe a hundred and eleven times.
                        And this not so pretty name
                        Is me.
                        .
                        
                        I stand in front of the mirror
                        When the day is all blind
                        And speak to the void
                        You have created inside
                        It is as hollow as the word they mouth
                        And it puts my demon back to sleep before its out.
                        .
                        .
                        My eyes open and brain awake
                        But
                        These voices make my heart numb .
                        ."My name is pretty", I shout
                        And turn all the curtains down
                        For this pretty name shouldn't speak a word you want
                        And these swollen eyes shouldn't cry on public benches you say
                        .
                        .
                        I stand up in the daylight now
                        And talk with my demons you had made deaf
                        dumb
                        and blind .
                        .
                        I turn off these curtains 
                        And let this numb heart breathe for a while.
                        .
                        .
                        I hear a pretty name being echoed away thousand miles
                        This name is me
                        I smile. .
                        .
                        I look for flowers 
                        On concrete now
                        And for sunshine
                        Beneath dark clouds
                        You repeat a name
                        If not less then maybe a hundred and eleven times

                        And oh, they're pretty.
                        So much. .
                        I wanted to be them at 15.
                        I am nervous ..of few things I never say..I never said. 
                        Do you see it in the unhappy jokes I try to laugh on?
                        Do you see it ?
                        Do you see what room I live in 
                        at the end of the day?
                        DARK. 
                        And my dark is pretty. 
                        My dark is silent
                        None like your dark.
                        None like any body's dark.
                        Do you see the moon I live under?
                        I look at the moon sometimes and walk
                        And it feels like 
                        the moon and the clouds  move with me
                        The sky
                        It accepts my demons 
                        And I accept its darkness.
                        Bet your clear sky isn't as pretty as my DARK. 
                        Because my light
                        It shines the best in this dark.

    I do not cry for the very first time when I see you because you know there are only a few emotions I understand and feel now. 
    I feel the love and the pain but I don't feel no tears now. 
    I feel the songs and I feel the blissful laughter but I don't feel no happiness now . 
    I feel, I love you more everyday even though I haven't heard your voice in years now. 
    I feel the imprints of our first kiss and I feel the warmth of the hugs but I do not feel your touch now. 
    I feel, I find you in people who love me but more than that I feel,I found you in myself.
    I feel,a part of my heart beats same like yours now.So when asked about love...I feel,I remember the pain it brings but I do not cry and im not as numb as I used to be before because I know you didnt cry too .
    I feel the ache in my heart and I feel the hand that cares but I feel no healing now. I feel beautiful and withered but I don't feel alive now.

                        And you smile so bright when you see me heading towards you , its a warm smile,something lovers would do. 
                        I want to smile back at you...and I do..I smile...
                        but its not a smile you want to see,
                        its not the smile that's happy..and its not the smile that could hide something only my eyes carry. 
                        You hold my hand so tight because you're afraid I'll fall.
                        And I admire your calmness when you understand the words I would never spill and I want to clutch your arms sometimes,
                        I want to accept this affection but I act numb as if numbness is all I got.
                        They talk about me and how weird I behave and i know they laugh at me for hours while they sip drinks.
                        And they are dizzy all their lives but they only vomit out lies. But you know I want to believe their lies sometimes because they say things
                        ...few things ...I always wanted to hear.
                        You ask me to sleep ...a good sleep ...and I like your voice, its soft and soothing and you're never rude.
                        You're my lilly I never wanna pluck you , I only want to admire you. I smile whilst wanting to sink down when I see you
                        ...when I see you wanting to live for me. But im afraid im not living this for the first time.
                        And im afraid ..because maybe, all we do is drive and think about the feelings that we hide.
                        Sick and full of pride . All we do is drive .

                        I remember a girl so timid...
                        so fearful of her actions , so afraid of people and so unaware of her feelings.
                        I would think why wouldn't she be happy and sometimes I'd think how can a person so weak even survive?!
                        But I forgot the autumn leaves are pretty. I forgot those dead leaves are pretty.
                        I know she dances infront of the mirror sometimes and she knows her hand and feet movement don't sync at all.
                        I see her write her emotions down on paper and she can never write words that rhyme.
                        I admire her strength when she  smiles whilst wanting to cry her teary heart.
                        I see her embrace love even more when she was taken all hopes from. 
                        She's like the autumn leaf she says but I see her living the brightest and glow golden while she opens up her heart. 
                        She taught me love is all about giving and let it grow if you're willing to. She taught me a leaf detached from the branch, 
                        lying on cold hard ground also breathes. 
                        She taught me a love so strong will only teach you to love more . You're an autumn leaf she said . Glow golden :).

                        You my dear friend are not meant to please everyone.People do speak a lot of shit anyway . 
                        Some speak about me , some about you and someone else talks about them , that's how it goes. 
                        Only know you're doing something great if they talk about you. Only know they're guilty if they discourage you. 
                        Only know they're the weaker one if they laugh on your tears . Only know you're beautiful if they call you flawed. 
                        Only know you're growing if they call you immature. Only know you're caring if they call you irritating . 
                        You're so much more than what they say. You're so much wanted - be vulnerable my friend :) you're pretty just the way you are 
                        ..the way they didn't see you .

                        Failed to describe the colour red and her failures were so much of a joke for them to laugh at," oh! See her fall" and I was among these few people ? 
                        Maybe I was..i've always been until Iwas the one standing infront of the mirror and watched her fall ,silent and dull, 
                        I looked at her making the same mistakes again. Sometimes I tried breaking the mirror but my fingers would bleed and my hands would shake. 
                        I turned back for her to not see my tears.She is naive.She is stubborn .A lil too much to handle.Clumsy and what not . 
                        I guess i have a confession to make - "she is me " . I wasn't really rising against my demons nor embracing the hands that wiped off the tears. 
                        My dad said life is as easy as finding out the square of 55 . I'm so glad i figured it out.

                        There‚Äôs a thing that I have realized with time, we‚Äôre humans and our brains can‚Äôt remember everything it comes across but it certainly does remember
                         the changes we come across in our lives maybe because change is the only constant. 
                        When I was eight my dad told me the word ‚Äú hundred‚Äù consists of the word ‚Äúred‚Äù so whenever I tried to figure out the spelling of hundred I knew it 
                        would end with ‚Äúred‚Äù. But it was only after my dad discovered the red in hundred that I found out just three letters could possibly solve all my problems. 
                        I was so busy counting your sins that I forgot dealing with mine. And we all have possibly spent more hours judging others rather than letting a person breathe 
                        in comfort. We all have spent so much time proving that we are right that we possibly ignored someone crying in the dark. And, here I am not talking to the ones 
                        who Judge. I am talking to ones who have spent their lives thinking they went wrong somewhere. And even the judging ones have had times they thought the same.‚Äù 
                        Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us‚Äù, didn‚Äôt know my school prayer had so much to tell me.

                        Let's talk about my fears on a Friday night.
                        300 feelings or 3 promises, you're gonna lie.
                        Tears that roll down the cheek
                        And disappear like your love when weak.
                        My heart is fragile if you find
                        Would you keep it, without our love gone blind?
                        And .
                        if love was a colour
                        I'd still see it blue
                        You'd paint it red
                        But
                        I'd only see you.
                        .
                        If i was a feeling you hide
                        Would i still be inside?
                        Weekdays,just fine
                        On Saturdays you'd make me feel like I'm on cloud nine.
                        I don't tell you when you're crossing a line
                        Can't hold you even if you're mine
                        That's when
                        We're losing the shine. . .// Friday night//
